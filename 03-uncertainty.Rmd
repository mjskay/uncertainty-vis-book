# Foundations: Uncertainty as we'll see it {#ch-uncertainty}

- primarily Bayesian perspective
    - unifies aleatory and epistemic
    - gives us one framework to work in
    - simplifies building things
    - simplifies communicating things (see e.g. confidence fallacy)
- will still occasionally touch on frequentist, usually as a subsection at the end of each chapter: 
    - tips on how to translate the visualization techniques presented into that mode
    - at times, visualizations unique to the frequentist approach that might be useful
