The why is based on what we currently know about how people interpret and make decisions from uncertainty visualizations, and the how is structured around generating uncertainty visualizations using the R programming language and the grammar of graphics.2 or what it will be—it is a work in progress↩ as implemented in the ggplot2 package (Wickham et al. 2018)↩ "],
