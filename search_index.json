The why is based on what we currently know about how people interpret and make decisions from uncertainty visualizations, and the how is structured around generating uncertainty visualizations using the R programming language and the grammar of graphics.2 or what it will be—it is a work in progress↩ as implemented in the ggplot2 package (???)↩ "],

(arbitrary or known in advance?) point estimates? employ frequency framing where possible (maybe a table here translating common non-frequency representations into frequency representations) quantile dotplots representative sampling in scatterplots (need a better name for this) spaghettis pixelated maps (also needs a name) use animation / HOPs anticipate deterministic construal errors think about task context, common elements of that context with plausibly similar abstract representations when animating / using metaphor, think about the mechanism - do we think of it as random?
