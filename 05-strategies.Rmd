# Foundations: General strategies {#ch-strategies}

*Dunno if this goes before or after all the specific examples*

- think about task
    - what do people actually need from the representation to do the task? densities? intervals? (arbitrary or known in advance?) point estimates?
- employ frequency framing where possible
    - *(maybe a table here translating common non-frequency representations into frequency representations)*
    - quantile dotplots
    - representative sampling in scatterplots (need a better name for this)
    - spaghettis
    - pixelated maps (also needs a name)
- use animation / HOPs
- anticipate deterministic construal errors
    - think about task context, common elements of that context with plausibly similar abstract representations
    - when animating / using metaphor, think about the mechanism - do we think of it as random?
